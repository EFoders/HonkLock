Future Feature Ideas (by priority):
 - Installer and choose where vaults are stored
 - Vault "key" that can be stored as a file/on a USB drive that will auto-unlock a given vault if the key is detected and the vault is configured to do so
 - desktop gui
 - browser extension w/ autofilling
 - linux support
 - passkeys
 - ?2FA auth keys?
 - allow syncing of vaults over QR code
 - allow connecting to private cloud (not hosted)
